## MPC Data Product: IHIS (__Integrated Health Interview Series	__)

Find it at <a href="http://ihis.us"> ihis.us</a>.

### **What is IHIS?**

The IHIS  integrates the NHIS (National Health Interview Survey) and makes the data available in one comprehensive data extract system. It contains annual health data from 1963 to the present. The survey asks many questions and those questions have varied greatly over time.  The NHIS public use files provide the source of the IHIS data.

As with other MPC data the "integration" applied to the data distinguishes the MPC IHIS from the NHIS data. Integration in IHIS must provide some common variables out of very different data across time. For instance,

	"...A second feature of integration in IHIS is combining, into a single variable, material covering comparable substantive ground but appearing in different
	types of files in the original NHIS public use data. For example, IHIS combines information on whether an individual had a usual place for medical care
	into a single variable (
	USUALPL)."
	
	"This information appeared for many years under different variable names and in several different types of files (including the Health Promotion and Disease
	Prevention, Cancer Control, Child Health, and Access to Care supplements and the core Sample Adult and Sample Child files) in the original NHIS public
	use files." [IHIS documentation]


As with all MPC data products the consistent browsable and searchable documentation adds a lot to the usefulness of the data.

### **Description of IHIS Data**

The data has supplementary information in some years on children and adults (different questions) At intervals the survey asks extra questions on topics. In 2002, 2007 and 2012 the NHIS included the Complimentary and Alternative Medicine questions, asking about use of "alternative medicine" and conditions people  used it for.

The data follows the structure of other MPC micro-data, grouping people into households, allowing researchers to study people in the context of their households and families. In addition to people and households, the IHIS data has many records attached to people, most of which MPC hasn't yet released publically (but we will.) every person got asked about every health condition they have, or in other years every injury they suffered. In future we plan to include these additional types of information for people:

*  X-rays
* Hospitalizations
* Prescription medications
* Non-prescription medications
* Doctor visits
* Motor vehicle accidents
* Device implant(joints)
* Device implant (fixation)
* Device implant (heart_valve)
* Device implant (lens)
* Device_implant (pacemaker)
* Device implant (other)

Not all years of the survey contain all the listed records under the person records by any means. Motor vehicle accidents only appeared as  distinct record types in two survey years, for instance.

In addition to offering data attached to individual people directly we aggregate some of this information from injury and condition records to attach to each person record, making the data easier to use in many cases. 

Each annual dataset contains approximately fifty-thousand households with all their people,around one-hundred to one-hundred thirty thousand people.
