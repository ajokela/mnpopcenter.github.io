<strong>Role: </strong>IT Director<br />
<strong>Project: </strong>All of them?<br />
<strong>Favorite Dev Tool: &nbsp;</strong>Coffee<br />
<strong>Fun Fact: &nbsp;</strong>Tallahassee is farther west than Detroit. &nbsp;Oh, you mean about me?</p>
<p><b>What&rsquo;s the coolest thing you&rsquo;ve gotten to work on at the MPC? &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Building the team. &nbsp;When I arrived here, the MPC IT core was 11 people. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re now on our way to 23, and I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of hiring 12 of the current members of the team (soon to be 17). &nbsp;Team building is incredibly challenging, but ultimately fulfilling as well.</p>
<p><b>If you were a programming language, what would it be? Why?</b></p>
<p>Perl. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t my first programming language, but it was the first language I truly loved. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s messy but practical. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t concern itself much with appearances - it just gets stuff done. &nbsp;It has chameleon-like ability to morph itself into the tool you need at that moment. &nbsp;This seems to me to be a pretty decent approach to life.</p>
<p><b>When you&rsquo;re not wrangling data at the MPC, what other things keep you busy? &nbsp;</b>Mainly, my 4-year-old son - I&rsquo;m pretty sure some sort of fusion reactor at his core is responsible for his ridiculous level of energy at all times. &nbsp;I also am getting more into biking (Minneapolis rubbing off on me, I guess) - I bought my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; bike last year and I&rsquo;ve been trying to make the 11-mile commute to work as often as I can. &nbsp;I catch up with hockey late at night with the DVR.</p>
<p><b>What was the last thing you presented on / wrote about?</b></p>

<p><b>What new skill(s) are your currently trying to learn? &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I try to dedicate time each week to keeping my technical skills sharp. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been playing with some APIs (Google, Evernote) and Apache Spark lately.</p></p>
