<strong>Project: </strong>TerraPop, ACE, Bibliography, eBook Library, this blog<br />
<strong>Favorite Dev Tool:&nbsp;</strong>Google<br />
<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>I&rsquo;ve been to 34 countries.</p>
<p><b>What brought you to your current professional field?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a career changer. My background is in Architecture and City Planning. After finishing my graduate studies, I ended-up working in the energy world for about 5 years doing policy and finance work. The tech world has always intrigued me though and I started messing around building web sites in the mid 2000s. In 2012 I participated in a Rails Bridge and started to seriously consider making the switch. In 2013 I headed out to NYC to attend the Flatiron School, a 12 week web development bootcamp, and BOOM. Here I am.</p>
<p>Working at the MPC has been my first foray into web development and it&rsquo;s been a great place to learn. In my previous lives I worked&nbsp;with GIS and for thesis in graduate school included a&nbsp;spatial analysis of 3 urban regions in Europe. I fit right in with the data nerds at the MPC.</p>
<p><b>When you&rsquo;re not wrangling data at the MPC, what other things keep you busy?</b></p>
<p>Due to a poorly considered pinky swear&nbsp;a few months ago, I'm now training to do a Half Iron Man next summer. For the next 6 months I&rsquo;ll be doing a ton of swimming/running/biking. &nbsp;I also do some salsa and tango.</p>
<p><b>How do you get to work?</b></p>
<p>Speaking of biking, I try to ride as much as I can. I live just 2 miles up the river from the West Bank, so have a great commute along the West River Road trail to work. Many mornings this fall I caught gorgeous sunrises over the Hennepin Avenue Bridge. The whole ride takes me approximately 11 minutes door to door--not bad. I&rsquo;m also trying to ride a couple of days a week this winter when the trails aren&rsquo;t too slick. Otherwise I hop on the Green Line.</p>
<p><b>What was the last thing you presented on / wrote about?</b></p>
<p>Last spring I did a presentation at <a title="Build the API First" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlZ1A-d5x5U" target="_blank">Rails Conf in Chicago, IL on APIs</a>. It was my first time presenting at a tech conference, and well, it was my first big tech conference as well. I kind of tossed myself into the deep end of the pool, but it was a great experience. In preparation I did practice runs of my talk at both Ruby.MN and Rails.MN. The local community was super supportive and gave a lot of great feedback. All in all it was a really great experience. It was super intimidating, but I&rsquo;m glad I bit the bullet and went for it.</p>
<p><b>What new skill(s) are your currently trying to learn?</b></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a civic tech project on the side. Earlier last spring I pulled together a multidisciplinary team to apply for a civic technology grant from the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs at the UofM. We were given a small grant to build a prototype of an application that makes the City&rsquo;s governing process more open and accessible. This project has been a fun opportunity to learn about mapping technologies and integrating with various APIs, as well as working with a multi-disciplinary team and interfacing with local government.</p>
