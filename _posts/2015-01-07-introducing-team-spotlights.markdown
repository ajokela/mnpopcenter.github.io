<p>A big part of the fun of working at MPC IT is collaborating&nbsp;with <a title="Meet the Team" href="http://tech.popdata.org/meet-the-team/" target="_blank">all of the people here</a>!&nbsp;We've got a pretty diverse group&nbsp;of individuals, many of whom ended up here via some fairly non-traditional paths. We thought it would be neat&nbsp;to spotlight staff&nbsp;members in order to add&nbsp;some depth to their background and interests and give a more human perspective to the team&nbsp;behind our products.</p>
<p>To that end, we've just launched our Spotlight series. Every month we'll do a mini-interview (minterview? mininterview?) with a different staff member.&nbsp;The questions will be a mix of serious and silly, tech and non-tech. &nbsp;To get things started, three intrepid staffers graciously agreed to be guinea pigs.</p>

<p>Look for more starting in February!</p>
