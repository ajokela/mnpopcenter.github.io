* <b> What brought you to your current professional field and eventually to the MPC? </b>
I had some experience in Ruby On Rails and was planning on continuing in it. So, after graduating from University Of Idaho I started looking for ROR positions and saw the vacancy in MPC. Accordingly I applied for it and later got hired.


* <b> What’s the coolest thing you’ve gotten to work on at the MPC? </b> 
I am in the IPUMS team at MPC. The IPUMS project is a family of 10 different microdata projects that shares the same codebase. Each of these microdata project further comprises of four different environments. The extensive use of environment variables to differentiate an individual project from possible 40 combinations (10 projects * 4 environments per project) is pretty awesome. 


* <b> When you’re not wrangling data at the MPC, what other things keep you busy? </b> 
When not at MPC I usually find myself hanging out with his friends, biking, watching movies/documentaries, going for a walk etc.


* <b> How do you get to work? </b> 
I live close to the university so often walk or bike to work. During winter when both aren't possible I take the bus.


* <b> What new skill(s) are your currently trying to learn? </b> 
I have been trying to learn Android programming but haven't been able to make a strong commitment into it. However, it is still at the top of my list.


* <b> What are your experience working at MPC? </b> 
MPC is a great place to work at. The people here are very nice and friendly. It has been almost a year I joined MPC, and have been liking it a lot.
