<p><b>What brought you to your current professional field? What brought you to the MPC?</b></p>
<p>I became interested in computer programming when I participated in an after-school program at the age of 11. &nbsp;The after-school program dealt with mathematics, science, basic engineering, and computer programming (on Apple IIe computers). &nbsp;After my freshman year of high school, I had really settled on computer science as the field I&rsquo;d like to study.</p>
<p>I left my hometown after a couple years at the local community college in the very early 2000s. &nbsp;I headed to Duluth, MN. &nbsp;I worked for the University of Minnesota Duluth for quite some time. &nbsp;In 2010, the Minnesota Population Center showed up on my radar as a potentially cool place to work. &nbsp;I interviewed, and was offered a developer position at that time, but because of a health issue that had just presented itself, the thought of dealing with a new job as well as moving all seemed too much for me at that time.</p>
<p>In 2012, I saw that the MPC had an opening. I had kept in contact with the then director of IT; after a bit of thought and conversation with the director, I applied... and I have been at the Population Center for nearly three years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What&rsquo;s the coolest thing you&rsquo;ve gotten to work on at the MPC?</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the most impactful thing for Terra Populus, but I really enjoyed writing a parenthetical expression parser for a piece of software we call a <i>tabulator</i>. &nbsp;The tabulator is basically a way to produce aggregate values from census microdata based on certain rules. &nbsp;Researchers needed the ability to write more complicated rules which included being able to write rules which included blocks separated by &ldquo;OR&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the second coolest thing I worked on was a bit of code that allows foreign-key relationships to be expressed in more-human-readable terms in data. &nbsp;This is written in Ruby, makes heavy use of Arel (relational algebra) as well as Ruby&rsquo;s metaprogramming abilities. &nbsp;The code can be found on Github.com - https://github.com/ajokela/mound</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>When you&rsquo;re not wrangling data at the MPC, what other things keep you busy?</b></p>
<p>I hike, snowshoe (assuming there is snow), and travel now and again. &nbsp;I also tend to my honeybees; my wife and I were keepers of ten hives last year, and we&rsquo;re likely to add a couple more hives this year. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m also assistant overlord to a small flock of chickens. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m also marginally obsessed with alternative energy. I recently installed a set of solar panels on the roof of our chicken coop to provide electricity for the chickens&rsquo; heated waterer and such.</p>
<p>I am also an avid follower of financial markets.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><b>How do you get to work?</b></p>
<p>Automobile fueled by petroleum distillate. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a Volkswagen.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><b>What was the last thing you presented on / wrote about?</b></p>
<p>The last thing that I had published (and not in the academic sense of publishing) was an article in American Beekeeper. &nbsp;The article was about a trip I took to Japan to visit beekeepers who use traditional methods as well as using native bees (<i>Apis cerana japonica</i> as opposed to the <i>Apis mellifera</i> that are used in the US).</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><b>What new skill(s) are your currently trying to learn?</b></p>
<p>Outside of the daily grind, I have been playing with candle making. &nbsp;With ten+ honeybee hives, there is a considerable amount of wax produced. &nbsp;The process of making candles is part art (the look and feel aspect; the label) and part science (what sort of candle do you get when you combine other lipids). &nbsp;More closely aligned with the daily grind, I have been getting to participate in an Emerging Leaders in IT program the University is sponsoring.</p>
