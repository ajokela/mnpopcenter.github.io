<p>Home base for the MPC IT Core is <a title="Willey Hall" href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/maps/WilleyH/" target="_blank">Willey Hall</a> on the West Bank of the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota. With the Mississippi River and the sprawling East Bank campus just out&nbsp;our front door, and the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood and downtown Minneapolis out the back, we're in a convenient, beautiful, and connected spot. Our workspace balances collaboration with privacy, and campus offers&nbsp;lots of&nbsp;options for hiding away when focus time is needed.</p>
<h3>Our Office</h3><br />
We've worked hard to create a healthy and productive space, and you'll notice attention to details like ergonomic work areas and thoughtful tech in the&nbsp;conference rooms. Sometimes it's the little things that put a smile on our face, like taking a break&nbsp;on the comfy chairs in the&nbsp;lounge and watching the Green Line trains roll by, enjoying the Peace Coffee we brew in the kitchen, or wandering into a bounty of homegrown veggies that a co-worker has brought in to share.</p>
<h3>Our Community</h3><br />
Hang around our office long enough and you're bound to run into&nbsp;an interesting gathering. Maybe&nbsp;you want to satisfy&nbsp;your&nbsp;intellectual curiosity? Try our&nbsp;seminar series, with talks that highlight the impact of our work around the world. Hungry?&nbsp;Then our monthly summer BBQs, fall chili cookoff, or holiday party might be just the ticket. Had a long week of coding? Wind down with the team at our weekly Friday wrap-up. And while you're wandering though, be sure to check out the research posters and technical&nbsp;diagrams - we're fortunate to get to work with such a talented and smart group of folks, and the proof is hanging on our walls.</p>
