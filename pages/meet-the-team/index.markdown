### Colin Davis
<a href="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/colin.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-422 size-thumbnail alignright" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/colin-150x150.jpg" alt="colin" width="150" height="150" /></a>Colin originally got interested in tech through game programming. He ended up working as a call center technician for Zeos/Micron in the mid 90s, during which he spoke to around eight thousand people, most of whom you could locate on an anger spectrum ranging from mildly put out to incoherent with rage. He left to begin a startup in the lead-up to the tech crash.

Colin started at MPC in 2001 as a "Junior Application Programmer" and now works a senior software developer. He's been responsible for data extraction for the MPC's end users (the "Extract Engine") for IPUMS and Terra Populus and NHGIS in its latest version. Also responsible for data conversion on all microdata products.

Currently he uses C++ 11, Java and Ruby professionally. For hobby projects Colin has also tinkered with Go, D, Scheme, Perl, and is interested in learning Rust and Clojure.

(Colin has also been <a title="IT Core Spotlight: Colin Davis" href="/it-core-spotlight-colin-davis/">Spotlighted</a>!)

### Jimm Domingo
<a href="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/domingo.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-707 alignright" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/domingo.jpg" alt="domingo" width="150" height="150" /></a>Jimm has been hacking since... well, since Hector was a pup.  At least, back when hacking didn't mean cracking.  Long before this fad of connecting a series of tubes into an interweb...

After working at a commercial database shop in California, Jimm moved into the ivory tower.  For the past couple decades, he's been developing research software at universities around the US (New Hampshire, Oregon, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Indiana).  And now in Minnesota after joining the MPC in 2015.

Here at MPC, Jimm toils away in the Data Production group, helping improve the tools and infrastructure that researchers use in their data workflows (when he's not writing about himself in the third person).

### Dan Elbert
Dan has been writing software since 2005 when he started as a Microsoft developer for a small consulting company.  After 7 years of C#, Windows Forms, and IIS, he decided to make a switch and became a Ruby on Rails developer for the MPC.

In his free time, he enjoys homebrewing, cooking, canoeing, and tinkering with home automation.

### Jesse Erdmann
<a href="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/jje_pic-e1420578085161.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-426 size-thumbnail alignright" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/jje_pic-e1420578085161-150x150.jpg" alt="jje_pic" width="150" height="150" /></a>Jesse has worked on a diverse set of projects over his career. He has worked on firewalls embedded on NICs (and got to install some of them in the engine room of a not quite ready for deployment Navy Destroyer), connecting Electronic Health Records Systems at a start-up and developing data processing pipelines in pioneering cancer research here at the University of Minnesota. At the MPC, Jesse is working in the Data Production Group leveraging new technology to improve the speed at which new data is processed and released to the world. He has sworn a blood oath to find a way to wedge his long held passion for semantic technology into the MPC.

Outside of the MPC, Jesse has been deeply involved with the local soccer community, dark-clouds.com, as well as pretending to be a music nerd on a music discovery podcast and associated site at audiobonsai.com. His wife allows him to reside in their home in the Northeast Suburbs of the Twin Cities along with their pet Labradoodle and decidedly less furry human child.

### Fran Fabrizio
<a href="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/Fabrizio_Headshot-e1420664595616.jpg"><img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-432 alignright" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/Fabrizio_Headshot-e1420664595616-150x150.jpg" alt="Fabrizio_Headshot" width="150" height="150" /></a>Fran originally planned to become a garbage truck driver (coolest thing ever to this 4-year-old boy), but the gift of a PCjr when he was 8 sparked a hobby interest in programming, typing in BASIC programs from the back of Family Computing magazine. Years later, he would find himself in the right place (a science and tech high school) at the right time (the birth of the Web), which changed his life course completely and led him to a career in computer science and IT.

After several years in private industry he moved to higher education where he has been ever since, splitting time between software development, system administration and management.  In 2011 he moved to his wife's native Minnesota and joined the MPC, and has served as IT Director since 2012.

Outside of work, Fran is likely to be found making a horrible mess of the kitchen, cruising around on his bike, or hanging out watching cars and trucks with his son.

I originally got into computers when my dad started a custom build to order computer company when I was eight years old. Shortly after, I began building and fixing computers for my family and some friends.

In school I played the saxophone and studied jazz music and I eventually went to college to study jazz-performance. After a year or so I decided to keep music fun and switched my major to computer science, where I began to learn programming. I graduated a few years ago and I've worked for a few private-sector education companies, but I came to the MPC in pursuit of interesting problems and data that can be used in research to help solve some of our greatest problems.

I am currently working on dropping a shiny new UI on our Terrapop product.

### Willy Lee
Willy Lee started his web work while studying studio art at Carleton College. The web was something you could learn the entire body of knowledge in an afternoon at that time. He took his love of narrative and storytelling to this new medium and somehow stumbled upon a career. After a decade at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts doing all things web, he turned his focus to application performance. As a sysadmin at the MPC, he profiles and monitors system performance and works with our programmers and systems team to find ways to deliver speed and reliability to our users.

In his free time, Willy is a cycling advocate, election judge, outdoorsman, home chef, and enthusiastic diner. He lives in south Minneapolis with his spouse and three cats. He's always happy to talk about bikes, cats, food, cats, internet, cats, and internet optimization.

### Marcus Peterson
<img class=" wp-image-395 size-thumbnail alignright" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/from_wp/Peterson-Marcus-150x150.jpg" alt="Peterson, Marcus" width="150" height="150" />After many years of schooling in Civil Engineering, Marcus surprised his family, friends, and himself by taking a software development position at a Boston-area startup. A couple of jobs and a trip back to Minnesota later, he landed at the fledgling MPC in 2002, where he happily remains to this day.

These days, Marcus leads the development team for the ever-growing suite of IPUMS products (<del>7</del> 10 web applications and counting). Though management is now a big part of his job, he is thrilled to be able to write code on a daily basis.

When not planning work for the team or writing code, Marcus can frequently be observed running along the banks of the Mississippi. He also enjoys music, movies, and may or may not have a Star Wars addiction.

I originally wanted to pursue medicine and follow in the footsteps of my father to become a surgeon. However, interests changed as I grew closer to mathematics and physics to pursue engineering. I pursued a masters degree in Computer Science to strengthen my foothold on the subject. After graduation, I spent a little over a year at a startup before joining the MPC in April 2015 as an HPC Developer on the TerraPop project. Maybe in the future I will pursue a higher degree so I can add "Dr" to my name like my father.

My primary interests include hacking and scripting/automating small things. Recently I have developed interests in playing with different sensors and ARM chip boards. Other than that, I enjoy cooking and traveling. I hope to get into biking and explore more of the Twin Cities on bike.
