At ISRDI IT we support an ever-growing portfolio of data products, all branded under the IPUMS banner.

## What is IPUMS?

IPUMS provides census and survey data from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS integration and documentation makes it easy to study change, conduct comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze individuals within family and community context. These data and services are available free of charge.

These products cover a range of census and survey datasets from across the globe and the past two hundred years. Collectively, they represent 1.4 billion people (in aggregate - not personally identifiable information!) over more than 700 datasets.

You can fully explore these products on [the IPUMS website](http://www.ipums.org/).
